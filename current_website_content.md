### Content:
**Hey!**

**I am Rachel, the owner and Photographer at Little Image Photography.**

Photography has always been a passion of mine. I love being able to capture a moment, whether little or extraordinary. I specialize in newborn and child portraiture; both in studio and outdoors.

**Children grow so fast, and family dynamics change rapidly**

That’s why photography is so important! Because even on those imperfect days, there are always perfect moments. Capture those moments, preserve them as art, and cherish them for a lifetime!

Enjoy the beauty of my images. I look forward to the opportunity to capture your memories!
